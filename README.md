An advanced, real-time vehicle dashboard and analytics application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. This app simulates vehicle physics, displays dynamic data, performs health diagnostics, and offers deep analytical insights into driving performance and vehicle maintenance.

## üåü Core Features

### üìä Real-time Dashboard
A modern, dynamic UI displaying essential metrics like speed and RPM using custom-built animated gauges.

### üõ∞Ô∏è Physics Simulation
A sophisticated backend simulation that generates realistic vehicle data, including speed, acceleration, engine temperature, battery drain, and tire wear.

### üìà Advanced Analytics
- Interactive charts visualizing historical data for various metrics (Speed, RPM, Battery, etc.)
- Calculates and displays detailed statistics on driving efficiency and performance
- Time-frame selectors (1H, 24H, 1W, 1M) to analyze historical trends

### ü©∫ Vehicle Diagnostics
- A robust diagnostics engine that constantly monitors vehicle health (Engine, Battery, Transmission, Tires)
- Generates real-time alerts with severity levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)

### üîß Predictive Maintenance
- Analyzes historical data to provide intelligent maintenance recommendations
- Predicts time-to-maintenance for critical components based on usage patterns

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Firebase Integration
Utilizes Firebase Firestore for real-time data synchronization and persistence, allowing the app to stream and store vehicle telemetry.

### üöÄ Performance Optimized
- Built with a reactive architecture using Kotlin Coroutines and Flow
- Employs performance optimizations like caching (LruCache), data batching, and efficient state management to handle high-frequency data streams smoothly

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Tech Stack

This project follows modern Android architecture principles and leverages a powerful tech stack to deliver a responsive and scalable application.

### Tech Stack

- **UI**: Jetpack Compose for a fully declarative and modern UI
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Kotlin Coroutines & Flow for managing background tasks and handling real-time data streams
- **State Management**: StateFlow and SharedFlow for efficient and lifecycle-aware state management
- **Backend & Database**: Firebase Firestore for real-time data storage and retrieval
- **Dependency Injection**: ViewModel Factory pattern for providing dependencies

### Architecture Highlights

- **Repository Pattern**: A `FirebaseVehicleRepository` abstracts the data source, separating data logic from the ViewModel
- **Reactive Data Flow**: The UI reacts to state changes from the `VehicleViewModel`, which in turn collects data streams from the repository
- **Decoupled Logic**: Business logic is encapsulated in managers and calculators (`DiagnosticsManager`, `AnalyticsCalculator`, `PhysicsCalculator`), making the system modular and testable
- **Optimized for Performance**: The app is designed to handle high-frequency data updates efficiently through techniques like data sampling, debouncing, batch processing to Firestore, and strategic use of caching

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio (latest stable version, e.g., Iguana or later)
- JDK 17 or higher
- A Firebase project

### 1. Firebase Setup (Crucial Step)

This project requires a Firebase backend to function.

#### Create a Firebase Project
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project

#### Add an Android App
1. Inside your project, click "Add app" and select the Android icon
2. Enter the package name: `com.example.automobilemediaapp`
3. Click "Register app"

#### Download Config File
1. Download the `google-services.json` file
2. Place this file in the `app/` directory of this project (`AutomobileMediaApp/app/google-services.json`)

#### Enable Firestore
1. In the Firebase Console, go to the "Build" section and click on "Firestore Database"
2. Click "Create database" and start in test mode. This will set up basic security rules for development

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: The default test rules allow open access to your database. Do not use these rules for a production app.

### 2. Build and Run the App

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AutomobileMediaApp.git
   cd AutomobileMediaApp
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio:**
   - Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing project"
   - Navigate to and select the cloned `AutomobileMediaApp` folder

3. **Sync and Run:**
   - Let Android Studio sync the Gradle files
   - Select an emulator or connect a physical device
   - Click the "Run" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è). The app will build and install. The data simulation will start automatically

## üìÇ Code Overview

The codebase is structured to be modular and maintainable. Here are the key components:

### Core Files

- **`MainActivity.kt`**: The main entry point of the app. It initializes the ViewModel, sets up the Jetpack Compose UI, and starts the vehicle data simulation loop
- **`VehicleViewModel.kt`**: The core of the application's logic. It manages the vehicle state, processes data, interacts with the repository and managers, and exposes state to the UI
- **`FirebaseVehicleRepository.kt`**: Handles all communication with Firebase Firestore. It provides functions to insert data and reactive streams (Flow) to listen for real-time updates

### UI Components (Composables)

- **Screen Composables**: `DashboardScreen.kt`, `AnalyticsScreen.kt`, etc. - Define the UI for each screen
- **Custom Components**: `ModernCircularGauge.kt`, `EnhancedAnalyticsChart.kt`, etc. - Reusable, custom UI components

### Data Models

Simple data classes (`VehicleData.kt`, `DiagnosticsState.kt`, etc.) that define the structure of the application's data.

### Logic & Calculators

- **`PhysicsCalculator.kt` / `VehiclePhysics.kt`**: Simulates the vehicle's physical behavior
- **`DiagnosticsManager.kt`**: Contains the logic for checking vehicle health and creating alerts
- **`MaintenanceAnalyzer.kt` / `DrivingEfficiencyCalculator.kt`**: Perform complex analysis on historical data
